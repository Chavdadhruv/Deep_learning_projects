WELCOME TO OUR BRAND
Our success—in fact, our very existence—is a direct consequence of the idiosyncratic 
flavor and decor of each individual Landon property. While we allow (and encourage!) 
flexibility in our branding to reflect that individuality, it is also critical for us to 
maintain an overarching, distinct, and recognizable Landon brand that ensures each 
guest will receive the quality we are so well known for. The following describes each 
of the components that make up our brand, and assists you in creating documents, 
brochures, signage, advertisements, and marketing material that says “Landon” and 
allows the authenticity of its incomparable location shine through.

vision. It affects the array of services and amenities we offer, how we speak to and treat 
our amazing customers, and why we strive to use our purpose and values as an ever-
evolving road map for success.

OUR CUSTOMERS
Our guests are tourists and business travelers who 
want more than just a place to sleep—they want a 
home base in a culture-rich location that immerses 
them in that local culture. They are largely middle-
class to affluent individuals, couples, and families who 
are open to exploring and experiencing what makes 
each locale unique—who want every part of their 
experience to be an integral part of their memories. 
The majority of our business guests are from the tech 
and real estate industries, yet we have hosted events 
for medical, industrial, and educational professionals, 
to name a few.

OUR PURPOSE
MISSION STATEMENT
Landon Hotel strives to give each guest an authentic travel experience that honors the history 
and culture of the region. We want our guests to feel at home while immersing themselves in 
local arts, traditions, and ways of life.
VISION STATEMENT
Our goal is to always treat each of our guests as if they are the only one. We hope to open the 
eyes and hearts of the world to learn about and accept people of other cultures and traditions 
by living with and living as them rather than simply observing them from a tour bus window. 
We strive to continually reflect and represent our hotel locations with the reverence each 
deserves for its inimitable qualities and ethos.

OUR VALUES
Our core values are based upon the same ideals of our 
founder, Arthur Landon. Mr. Landon insisted that his 
namesake hotels be uncompromisingly comfortable 
with warm, sincere customer service by the best hosts 
in the business. He felt we should treat guests as 
friends, and every hotel should accurately reflect its 
respective location, fully embracing the culture and 
flavor of its people. Mr. Landon also welcomed the 
creativity and ideas of his employees, no matter what 
their position, because they, too, are largely long-time 
residents of the area, while he considered himself a 
relative newcomer. 
We chose HOME as an acronym for our core values 
since our founder felt so strongly about Landon 
Hotels feeling like home, no matter where they are.
Honor everyone
Our founder felt honoring all around him 
was necessary to not only build and expand 
business, but for living all of life fully and 
gracefully. We honor the guests who come 
to stay with us, we honor our coworkers for 
their ideas and dedication, and we honor 
the people and culture around each of our 
hotels. All of these experiences form who 
we are as a company and as individuals.
Open your mind
The best way for guests and employees to 
experience a Landon hotel is to be open to 
all experiences. There are always moments 
of discomfort when we experience new 
things, meet new people, or go to a new 
country. Keeping an open mind throughout 
events and encounters allows for more 
delight and gratification.
Make a difference
Take every opportunity to make a 
difference for the better. From a simple 
“hello!” to a guest, to assisting in guiding 
a guest in visiting local attractions, to 
opening our doors for the community 
during times of crisis as well as celebration. 
We feel it is our duty to support and 
champion our community.
Embrace the world
“We must always be open, and always be 
learning,” our founder declared. “And what 
better way to live than to make the entire 
world your home?” Arthur Landon truly 
embraced the world as a gift to all of us, 
and one he believed we need to take care 
of and cherish.

OUR SLOGAN
“You’ll feel at home in 
our neighborhood.”
Our slogan should always be set in our Essonnes font in either text 
bold or display bold depending on size (see pages 30-31 for more 
information) and is preferred in one of our core colors.

BRAND CHARACTERISTICS
Our brand characteristics are important descriptive traits that provide guidance in 
creating consistent brand experiences at every touchpoint whether it’s an encounter 
with different location staff, the look and atmosphere of a lobby or hotel room, or 
digital and/or printed content. They are the intangible qualities that make our brand 
more human and relatable to customers, playing a huge role in building our brand 
persona and ultimately, brand loyalty.

OUR BRAND PERSONALITY
There is no doubt that our brand reflects the 
personality of its founder, its employees, and the 
people and environs in which we are located. These 
distinctive traits mirror our core values and are 
replicated in our behaviors and interactions with 
communities and our guests.
adventurous + humble
Our forays into so many different and unique parts of the world must be peaceable and respectful. 
While we have a wide portfolio of knowledge and experiences, we must always look at a new hotel 
venture as an unpretentious integration into a community. We must remain humble and teachable 
from the beginning, and do our best to be of clear benefit to any community we are fortunate 
enough to join.
calm + confident
We are confident that we’re sharing the best of what we’ve learned and experienced in any of 
our locations. We share this with each guest to the extent that they wish, encouraging personal 
growth and experience throughout their stay.
helpful + honest
As you would imagine, our guests’ comfort, pleasure, and enjoyment are high priorities. And, of 
course, our number one priority for all of our guests is their safety, especially in areas of a city 
or country that they may not be familiar with. With all of these priorities at the forefront, we go 
beyond the typical hotel amenities to ensure that all guests are aware of any potential hazards or 
taboos they should prepare for or avoid. While this may seem counterintuitive in the hospitality 
industry, we feel it is part of the real experience that our founder wished all guests to have at the 
Landon properties.
social + sociable
No one can leave a Landon hotel untouched by the sense of community. We encourage local 
residents to take part in activities that are held at our properties, and in some cases, the Landon 
becomes a key part of a movement or change. While the primary purpose of our hotels is to house 
visitors from around the world, a secondary, almost mandated purpose, is to act as a gathering 
place for many of the community’s activities and calls to activism.

2.1
OUR VERBAL STYLE
Our voice and tone are key elements of the feeling 
around and about Landon Hotels. From the email 
confirmation of a guest’s stay, to our welcome when 
they arrive, our marketing materials and social media 
posts, employee guidebooks, menus, and magazines 
reflect who we are. All complement the other, and are 
influenced by our values, personality, and community. 
It’s key to communicate as if we’re always representing 
Landon Hotels—because we are. To this end, we’re 
engaged in our guests’ experiences, and sincere in 
our questions and responses. We’re informed, and 
never try to sell guests on features and amenities. We 
underpromise and over deliver, with or without praise 
or thanks. It’s just who we are.
VOICE & TONE TIPS
Simple styling. As a whole, we use The Chicago 
Manual of Style and the University of Oxford Style 
Guide as references for our writing.
Keep it personal. After any necessary initial 
introduction of a Landon Hotel, refer to us as “we” 
and “us.” For example, “Landon Hotels are offering 
a special Mother’s Day brunch. We’re happy to have 
you join us.”
Avoid hype. Often we’re called on to tout all the 
wonderful things about Landon. What we don’t do, 
though, is gloat or exaggerate. For example, we don’t 
call a feature the “best ever” or “best in the world” 
since it can’t be substantiated. 
Keep it simple. We don’t have anything against words 
with multiple syllables, but if there’s an option, go with 
the simplest and most understandable language.
Avoid native idioms, especially when speaking to an 
international or widely distributed audience. Sayings 
and expressions that have become an ingrained part of 
vernacular in one country or area may not make any 
sense when translated or used in speaking to another 
audience.
Our official, legal corporate name is The Landon 
Hotels, or simply Landon Hotels. However, depending 
on context, it can be appropriate to call one of 
our properties The Landon Hotel (usually with the 
location name following, such as The Landon Hotel, 
San Francisco), or a Landon Hotel (Before traveling, 
search our site to see if there is a Landon Hotel near 
your destination.). In informal context, it can also be 
referred to as the Landon.

OUR VISUAL STYLE
If we had to use words to describe our look, the first 
to come to mind are bold, classic, intriguing, and 
inviting. Our visual identity reflects each of these, 
and also incorporates the best of a hotel’s community 
and its people. Along with our voice, our look is key 
to communicating who we are to our guests and 
potential guests. No matter how eclectic a location’s 
hotel is, we must keep very specific communication 
goals in mind. We must be intentional in our message, 
clear and comprehensible in our design, and true to 
our values and purpose.

LOGO SYSTEM
Acting as the single most recognizable visual identifier for a company, a logo is an 
extremely valuable brand asset. Audiences should gain a sense of who the company 
is, what they do, and what they stand for in how the logo is designed and used. Our 
dynamic logo system and the following guidelines gives us the flexibility to showcase 
the uniqueness of our different locations, while also ensuring our logo system remains 
cohesive and consistent at every touchpoint.

OUR LOGO
Our logo embodies the meaning and feeling of 
The Landon Hotels. There is, of course, the literal 
representation of the TLH for The Landon Hotels. 
The TLH mark also conveys the idea of home away 
from home through its resemblance to a house. It also 
resembles a window, which conveys our idea of being 
a window on the world, wherever we are located.
It has been our goal since the beginning that our 
logo fit the brand’s purpose and personality. As our 
company has evolved, so have our brand assets. Our 
most recent changes to the TLH brand mark, albeit 
minor, has been refined to include more sophisticated 
colors that increase contrast with background colors to 
increase legibility. The new TLH mark is now composed 
of transparent overlays in which the initials overlap to 
add greater depth and balance within the mark. 
Our logotype has also changed. Most apparently, 
we’ve dropped “The” and “Hotel” from all locked-up 
versions in order to create a better balance between 
the mark and the logotype. Thicker stroke weights, 
offset diagonals, more nuanced letter-spacing, and 
other subtle changes increase overall legibility and 
scalability of the logo as a whole.

LOGO COMPONENTS & CONSTRUCTION
With the development and incalculable growth of 
digital technology, a single static logo no longer works 
as a “one-size-fits-all” brand solution. That’s where 
our logo system comes into play. A well thought-
out and designed logo system is all about flexibility 
and adaptability for unpredictable and evolving 
communication formats.
Our logo system includes a variety of logo 
components that can be straightforwardly applied to 
these ever-changing media formats. Components 
include color and/or orientation variations of a 
logomark, logotype, logo lock-up, and optional 
variable text. And, to ensure that our components 
maintain a cohesive and consistent look, they have 
been constructed over an underlying grid framework. 
This grid informs all sizes, shapes, proportions, and 
spacing of each component and can be seen carried 
throughout all aspects of our updated brand design.

OUR LOGOMARK
Inspired by the concept of home, our logomark originates from a 
combination of our initials (TLH) and a simplified building form, becoming a 
recognizable symbol that our customers have come to identify with over the 
years. Because of this, it may be used without our logotype whenever space 
is limited or a simplified version of the logo is required.
We have two logomark styles—filled and outline—available for use. Our 
filled versions are available in color (preferred), and ebony or dove for 
instances when a monochrome option is required, while our outline versions 
are available in our core colors—ebony, dove, indigo, amethyst, and gold.

OUR LOGOTYPE
For added flexibility, our logotype may be used without our logomark. 
However, until it has built enough recognition as a stand alone brand mark, it 
should include “The” and “Hotel” to help further identify the brand.
Our logotype is available in three different orientations—stacked, horizontal, 
and compact. While our stacked version is preferred, the horizontal or 
compact versions may be used when necessary. All are available in either 
ebony (preferred) or dove. Never recreate or use our logotypes in any other 
color including our core colors, black, or white.

OUR LOGO LOCK-UP
Our updated logo lock-up is the most inclusive version of our brand identity. 
It includes our name Landon in a simplified logotype (minus “The” and 
“Hotel”) and our recognizable and memorable logomark. Also, with the 
simplified logotype, our new logo lock-up allows us to add variable text that 
can be customized to our various hotel locations.
Our logo lock-up is available in either a stacked or horizontal (preferred) 
orientation and in color, ebony, or dove. While the color version is preferred, 
ebony or dove may be used when a monochromatic version is required.

3.5
SECONDARY SUBMARKS
Our secondary submarks offer even more flexibility 
when working with our brand assets. Due to their 
enclosures, they create a contained space to safely 
display our logo when placed over busy or similarly 
colored backgrounds.
We offer two banner submarks—attached and 
freestanding—with either the compact logotype or 
outline logomark. Both styles should always be used 
in the vertical orientation (as shown right) and are 
available in our core brand colors—ebony, indigo, 
amethyst, and gold with a dove logotype or mark and 
dove with an ebony logotype or mark. Never use any 
other color combination, logo version, or orientation 
than what has been assigned.
Our badge submark, while not our preferred logo, 
includes all our brand identity information and is 
visually reminiscent of our other marks. It should only 
be used where other logomarks and logotype do not 
fit or work in context. For example, since there is an 
opaque background on the badge submark, it can 
be placed over any setting without compromising 
legibility, whereas some of our other logos may be lost 
or illegible over certain colors, tones, and patterns.
Attached submark banners should always be 
anchored to the top of the page (shown left) 
or another object (shown below)—never to 
the bottom, sides, or floating freely. Use the 
freestanding banners whenever the banner cannot 
be anchored in this way.
Note: Our banners are also available for use as 
a brand design element without our logomark 
or logotype. For more information, see page 35 
(Banner Graphic).

LOGO INTEGRITY
To ensure our logo remains legible and its integrity 
is never compromised regardless of the space we’re 
working with, we have assigned clear space and 
minimum size guidelines to follow at all times.
To ensure that no other content encroaches on the 
readability of our logo, clear space that is equal to the 
cap height of the Landon logotype (X) should always 
be maintained around all logotype, or a four square 
logomark quadrant (Y) around all logomarks.
The minimum size of our logos have been set by the 
cap height of the Landon logotype in all our lock-up 
and logotype variations or the height of the logomark 
when used alone, and the height of the enclosure for 
our secondary submarks.
Our logos should never be scaled so that the logomark is smaller 
than 5 millimeters (20 pixels) or the Landon logotype is less than 
3.175 millimeters (12 pixels) high.
For our location specific logo lock-ups, never scale the Landon 
logotype to less than 5 millimeters (20 pixels) high or our 
secondary submarks to less than 15 millimeters (55 pixels) high 
and/or 9 millimeters (35 pixels) wide for our submark banners.

LOGO USAGE
To ensure our logo system remains cohesive and 
consistent, follow our simple logo usage guidelines.
A.	
Do not alter any colors. When there’s a conflict 
with background colors, use one of our secondary 
submarks or adjust the background for greater 
contrast and legibility.
B.	
Do not place in a shape that could be mistaken as 
part of the logo. If an opaque background is desired 
and an approved colored background cannot be 
added, use one of our secondary submarks.
C.	
Do not alter or add new text. This includes 
changing the color or size of the variable text, 
adding ‘The’ and ‘Hotel’ to our lock-up versions, or 
adding new text altogether.
D.	
Do not add effects or distort in any way. This 
includes, but is not limited to, adding drop 
shadows and textures, blurring, skewing, or altering 
proportions.
E.	
Do not violate minimum size or clear space 
guidelines. When space is limited, choose a simpler 
logo option such as our logomark, logotype, or 
banner submark options.
F.	 
Do not rearrange or combine elements. This 
includes, but is not limited to, placing unapproved 
logomark, type, and lock-up elements in our 
banner designs or using one of our standalone 
logotypes with our logomark.

COLOR SYSTEM
Colors are the first impression a brand can make. They set the tone for a brand’s visual 
style, and provoke emotions and experiences of the people who view them. They 
convey the personality of our brand, so it’s key that our colors appropriately represent 
who we are. When following the rules we have set in these guidelines, our colors are the 
building block on which we create all of our visual design.

OUR COLORS
Our core colors were created by pairing 
complimentary colors with one another, including a 
dark neutral (ebony) with a light neutral (dove), and 
a cool hue (indigo and amethyst) with a warm hue 
(gold). We interpret these colors as timeless and 
dramatic (ebony), dependable and peaceful (dove), 
imaginative and respectful (indigo and amethyst), and 
tradition and richness (gold).
Our accent colors are bold midtones that bring an 
additional invigorating and dramatic feel to our color 
palette. Paired with our core colors, their role is to accent 
the message at hand. For example, blackberry may 
be used for a more formal and serious occasion, while 
coral and emerald suggest a livelier and cheerier event. 
The deeper forest and rose colors portray calming and 
healing, as well as love, passion, and courage.
Combining these colors gives our brand both a 
feeling of trusted experience along with youthful 
sophistication and new adventures. In essence, our 
colors are all about creating opposing feelings—
understated, yet dramatic; calming, yet invigorating; 
mature, yet adventurous. This dichotomy creates an 
unexpected balance, captures people’s attention, and 
ignites the imagination.

BACKGROUND COLORS
To ensure our look remains consistent and our 
logos and content are legible across the brand, we 
have designated rules for what background colors 
are acceptable. It is important to remember that 
no matter what, contrast is key to ensure legibility 
and readability. If great enough contrast cannot be 
achieved, select different colors or another logo, such 
as one of our enclosed secondary submarks.
Our primary background colors—dove, white, and 
ebony—are the preferred background colors and 
are best for displaying our logos. All logos and colors 
(except dove) are acceptable to use on white and dove 
backgrounds, while only our secondary submarks and 
all colors (except ebony, blackberry, and plum) are 
acceptable to use on an ebony background.
For an added splash of color, we have designated 
indigo, amethyst, and gold as secondary background 
colors. Our badge and banner (dove or ebony only) 
submarks are the only acceptable logo options to use 
with these backgrounds.

COLOR USAGE
To ensure that we are consistent and balanced with 
our color usage, we have developed a color-usage 
pie chart to reference when choosing colors for our 
branded materials. We want to aim for a mature and 
fun look. In doing so, it’s important that you restrict 
your color palette to our foundation colors—ebony 
and dove/white—with only one to two accent colors 
for added interest.  
COLOR GUIDELINES:
•	Use ebony and dove/white as your high-contrast 
foundation colors.
•	White and dove can be used interchangeably.
•	Black should never be used to replace ebony as the 
dark foundation color; it is only acceptable to use 
black for smaller copy.
•	Limit your color palette to 1-2 accent colors; in 
longer materials, this can be expanded as long as the 
additional colors are not used on the same page.
•	Only use approved colors for backgrounds (see page 
25 – Background Colors).
•	Solid colors are preferred, but tints are acceptable 
when greater contrast is needed. However, 
never use a tint as a large color block, such as a 
background.

WEB ACCESSIBLE COLORS
When designing for online, we want to ensure that 
our content is accessible to everyone. This means that 
our text sizes, weights, and colors meet, or exceed, 
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) when 
placed over different color backgrounds.
Reference our chart for text and background color 
combinations that meet either AA or AAA web 
accessibility criteria. Please use only approved colors 
and combinations covered on pages 23-26. Tints are 
also acceptable to use, but should be double checked 
at aremycolorsaccessible.com.

TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM
Typography plays a huge role in brand recognition and perception. The typefaces we 
use and how we use them help establish our brand’s personality by connecting our 
voice with our visuals. But more importantly, typography has the ability to enhance 
or transform the meaning of our messages as well as the overall feeling of our 
communications. Follow our typography guidelines to properly depict the occasion and 
communicate clearly.

OUR PRIMARY TYPEFACE
We have selected the Adobe TypeKit font Brandon 
Grotesque as our primary typeface to use in all brand 
communications. It is a modern take on the elegant 
sans-serif fonts popular in the 1920s and 1930s. Its 
bold strokes depict strength and character, while its 
soft edges make it approachable and down to earth. 
It’s old-school elegant with an unusual just-low-
enough x-height to modernize its look. In fact, it’s 
what we use in this style guide for both headline and 
body copy due to its clarity and sophistication. 
SUBSTITUTE PRIMARY TYPEFACE
If Brandon Grotesque is not available for use, it is 
acceptable to use Open Sans (or Arial) in its place. 
Never use any other fonts as a substitution for 
Brandon Grotesque.

OUR ACCENT TYPEFACE
We chose Essonnes as our accent typeface to be 
used sparingly when we want content to stand out 
from surrounding copy. Designed by the founder of 
JTD Type in the 2000s, Essonnes’ design is based 
on the Didot typefaces that were developed in the 
early 1800s. It has refined lines, balanced weights, 
and remarkable readability in each of its forms. We 
love Essonnes because of its large selection of font 
families. Specifically, we like the display font with 
its thin, elegant vertical strokes for large copy and 
the text font with its chunkier, more legible vertical 
strokes for smaller copy. 
SUBSTITUTE ACCENT TYPEFACE
When access to this Adobe TypeKit font is unavailable, 
Georgia may be used as a substitution. Never use any 
other fonts to replace Essonnes to ensure our brand 
communications remain consistent and cohesive.

TYPOGRAPHY USAGE
Typographic legibility and hierarchy is key for clear and 
concise communication of our brand personality and 
messages. Not only should our typography be easy 
to read, but also visually engaging in order to increase 
memorability and elicit an emotional response. 
With variations in font sizes, weights, and styles, our 
typography becomes a design element all on its own. 
But most importantly, typographic hierarchy is crucial 
for drawing attention to important content within 
our designs. To ensure we’re consistent with how 
we use our typography, follow our basic typography 
guidelines.
PRIMARY STYLES & USES
BRANDON GROTESQUE BOLD
LARGE TYPE
Preferred for all primary headlines, subheads, and large display type, in all caps with 75 
point leading. Acceptable in any of our core colors, but never black.
BRANDON GROTESQUE LIGHT
Small Type
Primary font for all smaller primary text including body copy and lists. Preferred in dove 
and black, never ebony. Other core colors are acceptable, but not preferred.   
ESSONNES DISPLAY BOLD
Large Accent Type
Used in sentence or title case as our primary accent font for large copy that we want to 
stand out. It may be used in any brand color, but never black.
ESSONNES TEXT BOLD
Small Accent Type
Preferred option for small accent type, such as secondary subheads and labels. It 
should be used in sentence or title case and is acceptable to use in any color. 
SECONDARY STYLES & USES
BRANDON GROTESQUE MEDIUM
LARGE TYPE
Best used for large type when the preferred bold weight is visually too heavy for the 
context in which it’s being used. Same treatment and color rules apply.
BRANDON GROTESQUE REGULAR
Small Type
Should only be used in instances when our small, light weight type is difficult to read, 
such as white or dove text on colored backgrounds, small labels, or captions.
ESSONNES DISPLAY REGULAR
Large Accent Type
Best used for large, secondary type that should be differentiated, but doesn’t require 
the weight of the bold style option. Never use in all caps or black.
ESSONNES TEXT REGULAR
Small Accent Type
Used for small type that needs clear differentiation, but not the weight of the bold 
style. Never use in all caps, but is acceptable in black for long copy blocks.

SUPPORTING GRAPHICS
Supporting graphics are an extension of our visual language and help our customers 
navigate and discern information. Their simplified, structured qualities also provide 
added visual interest and personality to our brand communications. They should be 
used sensibly, supporting the core function and/or message being communicated.

OUR ICONS
Our icons were designed to help our guests quickly and easily identify 
desired hotel services and amenities. These minimal line graphics provide 
direction and clarity, as well as visual interest to our printed, digital, and 
environmental communications.
Our icons are available in all our brand colors. When choosing which 
color icons to use, careful thought and consideration should be given to 
determine the hierarchy of your content. Remember, brighter colors will 
demand more attention and therefore be perceived as more important. For 
clarity and simplicity, avoid using more than one icon color in your design.

OUR PATTERNS
Our geometric-based patterns set a sophisticated 
adventurous tone for our communications. Their 
classic shapes feel structured, while their arrangement 
and colors bring an element of light-hearted 
spontaneity and personality to our visual designs.
We have created six premade square patterns out 
of various indigo and amethyst squares. However, 
custom square patterns can be made by using our 
background dot grid and following these rules.
CUSTOM PATTERN GUIDELINES:
•	Styles: solid and striped squares (~2:1 ratio)
•	Sizes: 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 squares (~1:1 ratio); 
5x5 is acceptable for larger patterns
•	Colors: indigo, amethyst, and 50 percent tint 
amethyst (~1:1 ratio per square size/style)
•	Solid Squares should only touch other solid squares 
of a different color/tint at the corner and never 
overlap or float freely from other solid squares. 
•	Striped Squares should always equal five horizontal 
or vertical stripes per grid square (1:1 ratio), only 
touch other striped squares at the corner, and only 
overlap solid squares of different colors. Striped 
squares should not overlap other striped squares.

Do not allow solid squares to float freely; 
they should always connect to the corner 
of another solid square 
Do not align squares of the same style along their 
edges; they should touch only at the corners
Do not place solid squares over striped squares

BANNER GRAPHIC
Our banner graphic can be used to help establish 
visual hierarchy and separation, and also provides 
visual interest in a design. When used in support with 
our other brand identity elements, the banner clarifies 
and connects it with related activities or content by 
matching its primary color. 
We created two banner styles for added flexibility: 
freestanding and attached. Our freestanding banners 
should always be used in a vertical orientation with its 
white lines on the top and bottom as demonstrated 
to the right. Our attached banners may be used in 
either a vertical or horizontal orientation, but must 
be anchored to the top or left edge of the page or 
to another object such as a color bar or other solid 
design element. Pay careful attention that you do not 
alter or distort either banner style in any way that is 
not discussed here. Banners are available in all of our 
brand colors.
Our ebony, blackberry, and plum banners are only 
acceptable to use on light backgrounds, such as white 
and dove, while our dove banner should only be used 
on dark backgrounds. All other banner colors can be 
used on either light or dark backgrounds as long as 
adequate contrast is achieved.

Attached banners should always be anchored to 
the top or left edge of the page or another object—
never to the bottom, right side, or floating freely. 
Use the freestanding banners whenever it cannot 
be anchored in this way. 
Our dark banners—ebony, blackberry, and 
plum—should only be used on light backgrounds 
and our dove banner should only be used on dark 
backgrounds. Our remaining banners may be used 
on either light or dark backgrounds as long as 
there is sufficient contrast.
Do not use unapproved colors, blending modes and 
effects, or color tints for our banners.
When placing text over banners, use white or dove 
on all banners except for dove. Our dove banner 
should always use ebony (black is acceptable 
for smaller type). Ebony (or black) text is also 
acceptable to use with our amethyst, gold, and 
coral banners. To verify that your text is meeting 
web accessibility standards, review the chart 
on page 27—Web Accessible Colors, or visit

PHOTOGRAPHY
Photography is a way to share our locations, services, staff, communities, and more. 
Not only are photos worth a thousand words, they should convey mood, tone, and 
possibility. Photos with people—both guests and members of the community—help 
give potential guests the confidence that they, too, can be a part of the Landon story. 
Sparking their imagination, they can envision themselves a world traveler, seeking 
adventure, tasting and seeing and experiencing all that they see in the photos. Use the 
following guidelines to best convey message and mood using photographs.

STYLE
Our goal is to tell authentic, human stories that 
others can easily relate to with our distinct style of 
photography. Candid, real, interesting, and intimate—
the most important style contributor in our photos 
is the idea of being a quiet, respectful observer, 
as if you’re sneaking a peak at a personal moment 
when the subjects may not be aware they’re being 
photographed.

COMPOSITION
How we compose our photos affects the stories we 
tell. To create a sense of intimacy and intrigue, our 
photos should be framed with a single focal point and 
use interesting angles and subject placement to direct 
attention to the photo subject. Tighter cropping and a 
great depth-of-field will also help focus attention on 
crucial story-telling content. Through framing, focus, 
and cropping, our photos are just as much about what 
you can’t see as much as you can.

COLOR
Colors in our photos should be simple, limited, and 
slightly muted, using a high-contrast color palette 
with one to two bold, rich accents. To create a 
desirable and compelling shot, the predominant 
color should be a light off-white, beige, or gray that 
occupies 50 percent or more of the color space, with 
a mix of warm and cool mid and darker hues splitting 
the remaining balance approximately 65/35 percent 
with one being a vibrant, eye-catching color.

SALES SHEET
SEE AND BE SEEN IN THE WEST END
Whether you’re a theater enthusiast, enjoy epic shopping, or love to 
stroll and people watch, you’ll fi
 nd  London’s West End has an endless 
opportunity to partake in all these activities. The West End is the heart of  
London’s “Theaterland” and off
 ers the best in drama, comedy, and musical 
productions. There are over 40 theaters in the West End, and staying at 
the West End Landon will put you front and center to them all.
When not attending a show, you can wander through miles and miles 
of the best shopping in the world, including Oxford, Regent, and Bond 
Streets. Feast your eyes on the endless choices of global brands and 
locally sourced goods that abound in the upscale department stores, hip 
boutiques, and unique crafter stalls in the West End.   
Then, at the end of the day, treat yourself to a relaxing and luxurious 
evening at the West End Landon. Enjoy a fi
 ve-star meal, overlooking the 
city, at the Landon Rooftop Cafe, followed by a soak in your room’s private 
jacuzzi tub. Then top off
  the day with a comfortable and restful slumber 
that will have you ready for another day of exploring the many sights 
around the West End.

“You’ll feel at home in our neighborhood.”
THE LANDON THAT STARTED IT ALL!
The original Landon still perseveres after over 50 years, although it has 
since had a facelift to improve infrastructure. The West End Landon is in 
a neighborhood that has something for everyone—from theater to dining 
to historic sights. That said, the Landon is far from being solely a tourist’s 
hotel. 
The community doesn’t just ebb and fl
 ow around the hotel 
—the 
community pours into the hotel, making the West End Landon an 
important venue for community activities and meetings. And the not-to-
miss rooftop cafe is a great place for travelers and locals to engage over 
drinks, food, and good conversation.
